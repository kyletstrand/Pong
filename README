This is a Pong clone which utilizes the Allegro C libraries
to handle the graphics.  

to play, simply use the up and down arrows to move your paddle
up and down. Try to hit the ball passed your opponent. 

Currently, it just plays one round and ends.

Allegro libraries are required for installation.
  -I will add Allegro installation insructions soon.
  -To install unpack the file and use the 'make' command.

Future additions:
  -Add multiple rounds.
  -Add text to the screen to keep score.
  -Create a menu with options to choose how many rounds to play.
  -Custum colors
  -Custom backgrounds


Feel free to play and edit the source code!

The paddle bounce sound uses the button_pressed.ogg from Ubuntu.
